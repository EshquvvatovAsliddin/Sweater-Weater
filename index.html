    <h3>And all I am is a man<br>
        I want the world in my hands<br>
        I hate the beach<br>
        But I stand in California with my toes in the sand<br>
        Use the sleeves of my sweater<br>
        Let's have an adventure<br>
        Head in the clouds but my gravity centered<br>
        Touch my neck and I'll touch yours<br>
        You in those little high waisted shorts, oh<br>
        Oh, she knows what I think about<br>
        And what I think about<br>
        One love, two mouths<br>
        One love, one house<br>
        No shirt, no blouse<br>
        Just us, you find out<br>
        Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no<br>
        'Cause it's too cold<br>
        For you here<br>
        And now, so let me hold<br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
        And if I may just take your breath away<br>
        I don't mind if there's not much to say<br>
        Sometimes the silence guides a mind<br>
        To move to a place so far away<br>
        The goosebumps start to raise<br>
        The minute that my left hand meets your waist<br>
        And then I watch your face<br>
        Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah<br>
        These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for<br>
        Inside this place is warm<br>
        Outside it starts to pour<br>
        Coming down<br>
        One love, two mouths<br>
        One love, one house<br>
        No shirt, no blouse<br>
        Just us, you find out<br>
        Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no<br>
        'Cause it's too cold<br>
        For you here<br>
        And now, so let me hold<br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
        'Cause it's too cold<br>
        For you here<br>
        And now, so let me hold<br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
        Whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
        Whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
        Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
        Whoa, whoa<br>
        Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
        Whoa, whoa<br>
        'Cause it's too cold<br>
        For you here<br>
        And now, so let me hold<br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
        It's too cold<br>
        For you here<br>
        And now, let me hold<br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater<br>
        And it's too cold, it's too cold<br>
        The holes of my sweater</h3>
